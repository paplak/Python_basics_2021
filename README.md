# Python_basics_2021
This is my final project from the 2021 Python Basics course at the Warsaw School of Economics.

My first webscraping project.
The task was to write a program to perform the following functions:
1. reads the parameters and prices of cell phones listed for sale on euroagd.com.pl and MediaMarkt.pl
2. writes down the prices of cell phones
3. identifies the cell phones appearing on both sites.
